## Cookielite Quick-Start
1. Add your environment variables to .env, e.g: `MAPBOX_API_KEY=fjbfkj397h4ou3fj34bfjlb4kll`
2. If you are working locally, activate the project environment: `conda activate paper-count` and start Jupyter Lab server: `jupyter lab`
3. If you are working on JupyterHub, open any notebook in the paper-count/notebooks folder, and when prompted select Python [conda env:paper-count] from the list of kernels
4. Install Python libraries using `conda install` or `pip install` (make sure the project environment is activated first!)
5. Package `import` statements should be centralized in imports.py
6. Regularly update requirements.txt using `conda env export > environment.yml`
7. Keep this readme up-to-date!
